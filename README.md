## General info
Class projects compilation from CS 189: Introduction to Machine Learning at Berkeley. Implemented various neural network models including feedforward neural network in numpy, convolutional neural network and attention, transformers in Pytorch. 

Feedforward neural network with activation function, forward pass, backpropagation, gradient descent and 5-fold cross-validation modules from scratch in Numpy with 98.8% test accuracy.

Implemented deep networks including fully-connected neural networks, convolutional neural networks with Max Pooling and regularization, and Transformers using Pytorch. Models achieved 99% test accuracy.
